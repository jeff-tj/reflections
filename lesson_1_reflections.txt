* Different versions can help you visualise the changes that have been made
* This allows you to easily look to the changes, because if the code
has stopped working and it was working before, we can see what has been changed

* Entire history will allow you see changes and improvementst that you have made
* This allows you to take what you have previously learnt and apply it again

* Pros - it allows a person who make logical changes before committing
* Cons - reliant on persons to know when to commit changes

It will depend on the logic of the system
Git - is designed as a repository of all files
Gdocs - assumes that each file will be separate

git log  - view the log of changes made
git diff - see the difference between two versions (old new)
get checkout - go back to a previous version

Version control allows you to more confidently makes changes
Allows you to revert to a working version if there are unexpected changes

Will use git for version control in data research
